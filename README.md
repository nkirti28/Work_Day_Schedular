# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code - Third Party APIs (moment.js)

For this challenge, you will build a Calender Application that allows user to save events for each hour of day.
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
This application uses the Moment.js library to work with date and time.

## USER STORY
